## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Accounts and the catalog** — the server keeps Accounts, sessions, Tracks,
  Sources, and Playlists in SQLite with migrations. The first Account becomes the
  admin; the server has one Account unless the config file lets the admin create
  more. You sign in and out, or out everywhere, and a
  lost password is reset with `medleyplay reset-password`. Each Account has its
  own favorites, ratings, and Playlists. `medleyplay serve` runs the API. See the
  [Architecture](docs/contributing/design-notes/Architecture.md#accounts) note.
- **Plugins** — features arrive as plugins that run in a separate plugin host
  process, so a plugin that raises, hangs, crashes, or leaks can't take the
  server down. A plugin that fails to load is quarantined, and one that keeps
  failing is faulted until an admin resets it. `medleyplay.toml` in the data
  folder turns plugins on and off, `medleyplay serve --safe-mode` starts with
  all of them off, and `GET /api/plugins` shows each plugin's state. See the
  [Plugin host](docs/contributing/design-notes/Plugin%20host.md) note.

### Changed

- Renamed the project from stream to medleyplay.

### Removed

- **The 2019 prototype** — the Express server, the Create React App client, and
  the library-file builder are retired ahead of a rewrite. They remain in the git
  history.
